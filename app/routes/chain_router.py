    ### Simple sequential forward-fed chaining of language models. Single i/o.
    
    Sequential chains are defined as a series of chains, called in deterministic order. 
    There are two types of sequential chains:
    `SimpleSequentialChain`: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.

    First chain takes in the title of an imaginary play and then generates a synopsis for that title, and the second chain takes in the synopsis of that play and generates an imaginary review for that play.

    Chains that involve multiple inputs, and where there also multiple final outputs.
    Of particular importance is how we name the input/output variable names. 
    In the above example we didnâ€™t have to think about that because we were just passing the output of one chain directly as input to the next, but here we do have worry about that because we have multiple inputs.

    ### General purpose sequence with memory ie. information passed as context for each stage in the pipe.
    
    Sometimes you may want to pass along some context to use in each step of the chain 
    or in a later part of the chain, but maintaining and chaining together the input/output variables can quickly get messy. 
    Using SimpleMemory is a convenient way to do manage this and clean up your chains.

    This offloading leverages an LLM that can decompose a natural language problem into programmatic steps, which is fortunately available using contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs that are pre-trained on both natural language and programming languages
